    <h1>‘Health Defenders’ Jailed in Iran Wanted to Sue Supreme Leader Over Covid</h1>
    <q>Two lawyers and a civil rights activist who were outspoken about Iran’s chaotic response to the pandemic and delays in its vaccine rollout are on trial now, charged with threatening national security.</q>
    <p>Two Iranian lawyers and a civil rights activist were among a group organizing a legal challenge to Iran’s top leader and the government over their disastrous handling of the pandemic.</p>

<p>But before they could even file their complaint, they were <em>seized and incarcerated.</em></p>

<p>Now known on Iranian social media as “the health defenders,” their case has attracted widespread attention, even though their trial in Tehran is not open to the public.</p>

<p>“We were still discussing the complaint and what to do when 15 intelligence agents from the judiciary violently broke into the office and arrested us,” the civil rights activist, Mehdi Mahmoudian, said in a phone interview from Tehran’s high-security Evin prison, where he is being held along with his co-defendants, lawyers Mostafa Nili and Arash Kaykhosravi.</p>
